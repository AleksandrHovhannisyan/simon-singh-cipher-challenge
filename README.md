# Simon Singh's Cipher Challenge

This repo contains my attempts at solving [Simon Singh's Cipher Challenge](https://simonsingh.net/cryptography/cipher-challenge/the-ciphertexts/), which he posed to his readers in his book on cryptography, [*The Code Book*](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/). I highly recommend checking it outâ€”it's one of the most fascinating and informative books I've ever read. Singh's accessible storytelling turns an academic and technical subject into something that even lay people would find interesting.

Note that the challenge was already completed long before I read this book, so this is merely for practice/fun.
